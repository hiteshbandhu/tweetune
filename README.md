# tweetune

This tool allows you to process tweet data extracted from Twitter Analytics and generate relevant questions based on the content of each tweet. It consists of two main steps: cleaning the tweet data and then generating questions from the cleaned data.

## Overview

1. **Step 1**: Clean and preprocess your tweet data.
2. **Step 2**: Generate questions based on the cleaned tweet data.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `groq`

You will also need an **GROQ API key** to generate questions from tweets.

All the code is available in the `src` folder.

## Step 1: Clean and Preprocess Tweets

In this step, you will clean and preprocess the tweet data by removing unwanted elements like mentions, hashtags, and URLs. Additionally, tweets shorter than a specified character limit will be filtered out. Use `clean_data.py` for this purpose.

### Requirements

- A CSV file containing tweets downloaded from **Twitter Analytics**. Ensure the file includes a column named `Post text`, which contains the tweet text.
  
### Key Control Variables

- `MAX_CHARS`: Minimum number of characters a tweet must have to be included.
- `REMOVE_MENTIONS`: Set to `True` to remove mentions (`@username`).
- `REMOVE_HASHTAGS`: Set to `True` to remove hashtags (`#hashtag`).
- `REMOVE_WEBLINKS`: Set to `True` to remove URLs (web links).

### Process

1. **Input CSV**: Load the CSV file containing tweets.
2. **Sorting**: Optionally, sort the data by impressions.
3. **Filtering**: Filter out tweets with fewer than `MAX_CHARS` characters.
4. **Cleaning**: Remove mentions, hashtags, and URLs based on control variables.
5. **Output**: Save the cleaned data into a new CSV file.

## Step 2: Generate Questions from Cleaned Tweets

After cleaning the tweet data, the next step is to generate questions based on the content of each tweet. Use `generate_questions.py` for this purpose

### Requirements

- The cleaned tweet CSV from **Step 1**.
- An **GROQ API key** to generate questions.

### Process

1. **Input CSV**: Use the cleaned CSV from Step 1.
2. **Question Generation**: The tool will use the OpenAI API to generate relevant questions for each tweet.
3. **Output**: A new CSV will be created containing the original tweet and the generated question.

## Example Output

After running the scripts, your final output CSV will include two columns:

| tweet                                      | Generated Question                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| "I am learning machine learning!"          | "What aspects of machine learning are you focusing on?"   |
| "What's the future of AI?"                 | "How do you envision the future of AI impacting industries?" |
| "How do you use GPT-3 effectively?"        | "What are the best practices for using GPT-3 in applications?" |

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tweet-question-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tweet-question-generator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Obtain your **GROQ API key** and set it up for use with the question generation script.

## Running the Tool

### Step 1: Clean the Tweet Data

Run the cleaning script on your downloaded Twitter Analytics CSV file to preprocess the data:

```bash
python clean_data.py
```

After this step, youâ€™ll have a CSV file with cleaned tweet data.

### Step 2: Generate Questions

Run the question generation script to create questions from your cleaned tweet data:

```bash
python generate_questions.py
```

You will receive a CSV file containing the original tweet and the generated question for each tweet.
